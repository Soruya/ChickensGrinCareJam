  dialogue:
  - In a distant forest, a small human child was left alone, crying in the woods.
  - But no matter how hard he cried, no one came to his aid.
  - At least, no human did.
  - A lone fairy who kept watch over the forest found him and decided to take him
    in.
  - She regarded him as her son and took care of him over the years.
  - This is their story.
